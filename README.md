# Data-Mining-Web-Scraping
Mining of news updates that speak to banditry

The python file titled **News_Data_Mining** contains the step by step process that was involved to mine news that center on banditry from the Punch, Nigeria, get their links, date reported and the news content itself.

The python file titled **Smartphones_Data_Mining** also contains the step by step process in mining Smartphones' details from an Online Shopping Platform, quite different from the News_Data_Mining but it was a whole lot of adventure.

Have fun going through my python files.
